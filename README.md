#Outline of R Package

#Package Name:HealthierU

#Create Function called Health Analysis
In this function, we will take health variables such as Height and Weight to  establish a diagnosis of their BMI. We will write an equation for BMI. No web scraping will be needed.

#Create Function called PopGraph
This function will graph your statistics in comparison to the rest of the U.S. population and print out the diagnosis of underweight, normal, or obese. We will conduct web scraping and use ggplot for graphing. 

#Create Function called Personal Trainer
For this function, we will develop a personalized exercise regimen based off of your current weight, your target weight, and the period from now until the target date. We will incorporate the intensity of the exercise and the number of hours desired to exercise weekly. This will in turn ouput a list of activities. 
We are planning on webscraping data from: http://www.nutristrategy.com/caloriesburned.htm

*Each member of the group will write one of the three functions and assist the other group members in editing the others.
